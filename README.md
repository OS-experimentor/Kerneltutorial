# Hi! This is a tutorial on how to write a basic, bare-metal kernel.
The tutorial assumes you have a way to actually **load** the kernel. If you don't like writing your own bootloader, use GRUB or something.
To go to the next part (since they all use the same file), ***scroll down*** till you get to a part label **(e.g. // Welcome to part X!)**

## What does the kernel do?
In the tutorial kernel, it writes to VGA, handles input, and parses commands. Feel free to make changes, add more commands, or even correct me.
Not much else to write, so have fun!
